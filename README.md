# NASA-Space-Apps-2020

This application was made as a part of the '**NASA Space apps challenge-2020**' where the challenge my team and I chose was '**What is our Carbon Footprint**'. We came up with a simple C program that calculates the number of trees needed to balance out the carbon emmitted in a region. We also made a detailed presentaion to spread general awareness on Carbon Emmision, the amount of carbon emmitted by different industries, its harmful effects and various solutions on how we could improve the carbon emmission of a certain region.     
We went on to win the first round on campus and get selected as a **Global Nominee.**
